# Adapters

This library contains additional adapters to use with the Microsoft Bot Framework.

## Installation

To install:

    npm install @botbuildercommunity/adapters --save

## Usage

Each adapter can be used in much the same way, as its structure is inherited from the base adapter in the Bot Framework.
