# Bot Builder Azure Table Storage

Microsoft's [botbuilder-js](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js) team recently removed support for Azure Table Storage in favor of concentrating on Azure Blob Storage. They [have indicated](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/issues/277#issuecomment-414378519) that they would be supportive of the community spinning out the code base as a separate NPM module, so I am putting the initial code here in order to begin modifications to turn it into a separate module.

## Installation

    npm install @botbuildercommunity/storage-azure-table --save
